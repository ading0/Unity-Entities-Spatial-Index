## Unity-Entities Spatial Indexing

Spatial hashing library for Unity Entities (1.0+).
Compatible with burst and generic, which can't be achieved by using Entities in a vanilla manner.
Written for Unity 2022.3 LTS, but can probably be adapted easily to later versions since the Entities API shouldn't change too much post-1.0.
